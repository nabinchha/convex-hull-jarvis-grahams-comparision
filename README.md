Comparision of Jarvis March & Graham's Scan Convex Hull Algorithms
======

######Abstract
Convex hull of a set of points is the region that exclusively includes all of the points in the given set of points. There are different algorithms to find the planar convex hull of a set of points based on different time complexities. They include Graham scan, Jarvis march, Divide-and-Conquer, Optimal output-sensitive algorithms, and Akl-Toussaint heuristic. In this paper we will study the techniques of Graham scan and Jarvis march, and their computational speed. Jarvis march, the simpler of the two in terms of implementation, has a running time of O(nh), where n is the number of points in the set and h is the number of points in the hull. However, it has the worst case running time of O(n2) when all given points form the convex hull. Grahamâ€™s scan, with a more complex implementation, has a running time of O(nlogn).
